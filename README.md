Conceptualize an application using artificial intelligence and Ambient UX to manage the recruitment process more efficiently.

Virtualize the recruitment process in the form of a game. Simulation of a job interview / HR interview via a video-fun interface allowing candidates and recruiters to approach a 4.0 recruitment!


## LINK WITH AI + RPA + HYPER AUTOMATION 

The IA collects all CVs, sorts them according to HR criteria and schedules an appointment between HR and the candidate. And allows to offer more suitable technical maintenance test / mini-game.
 
## AMBIENT EXPERIENCE

This video-fun interface allows candidates and recruiters to pass the interview via a more attractive and innovative interface towards 4.0, The questions / answers and the interview take place via modules in the game. Then the technical interview can be used mini-games that the candidate must complete.
